                    My name is AJ Patel and I am a unique individual, 
                    to say the least. I love sports, investing, epic fiction, 
                    meeting new people, and traveling. Currently I am learning 
                    web development, and finishing up law school. (AND) Attempting 
                    to get better at Fifa, which is not going so well. I enjoy 
                    all sorts of music, if it can make me move a bit then I am IN. 
                    I hope to travel the world at some point in my life. Some of 
                    the places I have always wanted to go include Jerusalem, The 
                    North Pole, Thailand, China, Dubai, and many more. I played 
                    baseball in college. I have been crowned the wing eating 
                    champion twice in my illustrious, and short, competitive 
                    eating career. My favorite animals are monkeys, and I love
                    dogs. German shephard guys are my favorite. This is 
                    all just a bunch of random text, none of it is true. I needed
                    something to fill this space to see if I learned anything
                    from class or not. Or maybe some of it is actually true. 
                    Or maybe it all is.. who knows. I certainly don't. Excuse 
                    the grammEr and punktuation.
